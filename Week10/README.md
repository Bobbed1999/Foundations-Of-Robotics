## Week 10 Overview
### Topic Description
This week, our focus will continue on exploring the Velocity Kinematics (VK), delving deeper into the intricacies of Differential Kinematics and the derivation of the Geometric Jacobian matrix using the Linear and Angular velocities. We will specifically examine how these concepts apply to under-and-over-actuated manipulators, shedding light on their operational dynamics. Furthermore, our journey will encompass a thorough investigation into Velocity Manipulability Ellipsoids, providing a comprehensive understanding of how manipulators interact with and manipulate velocity within their operational space.

At the end of this course week, you will be able to:
Compute the Linear and Angular Velocities Jacobians of a serial-arm manipulator
Derive the Forward and Inverse Velocity Kinematics for under- and over-actuated manipulators
Find the velocity manipulability ellipsoids of a manipulator
