## Overview
This week, we will delve into the application of compound transformations commonly employed in the realm of robotic manipulations. Additionally, our focus will shift towards gaining a comprehensive understanding of orientation properties. This entails an exploration of the method to articulate a rotation matrix through three distinct parameters. Moreover, we will engage in the execution of three elemental rotations, a crucial process for effectively describing any orientation in the three-dimensional space (3D).
