## 
In this lecture, we will delve deeper into the intricacies of devising a control law tailored for the spring-mass-damper system and will explore the various factors and considerations involved in this design process. Furthermore, we will investigate the integration of a Proportional, Derivative, and Integral (PID) Controller into our system. This versatile control mechanism will allow us to finely adjust and regulate the response of the system, enabling us to achieve desired performance characteristics and stability. Finally, we will apply the linear control concepts to a two-link robotic manipulator.
At the end of this course week, you will be able to:

Design a control law and add a PID controller 

Fine-tune a PID controller to achieve the desired performance

Apply linear control to a two-link robotic arm
