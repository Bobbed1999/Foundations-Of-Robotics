In this session, we will explore the foundational principles of manipulator dynamics, focusing on how joint positions, velocities, and accelerations relate to the forces and torques required for motion. Understanding these dynamics is essential for designing effective control strategies and ensuring precise robotic performance. Alongside the technical content, we will also examine the ethical dimensions of robotics, considering how these systems impact human lives and societal structures. By the end of the lecture, you will have a deeper appreciation for both the mechanical intelligence behind robotic manipulators and the responsibility that comes with developing and deploying them. 

At the end of this course week, you will be able to:

Derive the rigid-body equations of motions

Question ethics in robotics
