# Week 1 ‚Äì Course Introduction, Robots & Terminologies

## Topic Description
This week introduces the fundamental principles of robotics:
- Types and classifications of robots
- Application areas across industries
- Basic terminologies for serial robotic manipulators

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of Week 1, I should be able to:
- Identify different types of robots
- Explore application areas of robots
- Understand basic terminologies for serial manipulators

## Lecture Highlights
- **Definition of a Robot**: any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner. (Britannica).  
- **Asimov‚Äôs Three Laws**: Safety, obedience, self-preservation.  
- Robotics is a rapidly growing field with applications in aerospace, healthcare, defense, industry, and more.

## Types of Robots
- Aerospace (e.g., NASA Robonaut)  
- Consumer (e.g., Roomba, Aibo)  
- Disaster Response (e.g., PackBots)  
- Drones (e.g., DJI Phantom, Skydio)  
- Education (e.g., Lego Mindstorms)  
- Entertainment (e.g., RoboThespian, Disney animatronics)  
- Exoskeletons (e.g., HAL, Guardian XO)  
- Humanoids (e.g., Honda ASIMO, Geminoid)  
- Industrial (e.g., Unimate, Baxter, Amazon warehouse robots)  
- Medical (e.g., Da Vinci surgical robot, prosthetics, IBM Watson)  
- Military & Security (e.g., PackBot, BigDog, Cobalt)  
- Research (e.g., Cassie, DASH)  
- Self-driving Cars (e.g., Waymo, Google Prius)  
- Telepresence (e.g., Ohmni, RP-VITA)  
- Underwater (e.g., OceanOne, Aquanaut)

## Key Terminologies
- **Kinematics**: Motion (pos/vel/accel), independent of forces.  
- **Kinetics (Dynamics)**: Forces causing motion.  
- **Manipulator**: Links + joints + actuators, fixed base + end-effector.  
- **Workspace**: Volume reachable by the end-effector.  
- **Degrees of Freedom (DoF)**: Independent joints; ‚â•6 DoFs needed for full 3D manipulation.  
- **Joint Types**:   
  - Revolute (R, Œ∏) ‚Üí rotational  
  - Prismatic (P, d) ‚Üí linear  
- **Manipulator Types**: Cartesian/Gantry, Collaborative, Cylindrical, Spherical, SCARA, Articulated, Parallel, Anthropomorphic.
